## You Raise Me Up Prototype
*see also the .pdf in the .zip file for further explanations*

Our prototype is a simple level design on cardboard since we wanted to focus on the core gameplay mechanics:
- autoscrolling
- drag & drop platforms
- level manipulation (physics)

The result of our brainstorming is described in the .pdf file. Also see the two gif files to get an impression of the prototype "in action".
